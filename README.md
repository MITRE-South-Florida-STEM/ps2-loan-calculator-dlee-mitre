# Information
Students, please carefully read the instructions in the PDF file. 
Please disregard the dates, but follow instructions about variable naming and file naming.

The final commit(submission) should include three separate files: `ps1a.py`, `ps1b.py` and `ps1c.py`

# Program Execution
`main.py` is used to run all three files. When `Run` is clicked, the Replit IDE will attempt to run all three files. 

It is not required to have all three completed to test run your code. The code should gracefully disregard errors in incomplete files. 

For example, let's say you wanted to start with `ps1b.py` and the other two remained empty. You would get the following output if `ps1b.py` had an `Undefined Name` exception.

```shell

*****************
running file ps1a
-----------------

*****************
running file ps1b
-----------------

    Error running file: ps1b
    Error: name 'x' is not defined

*****************
running file ps1c
-----------------

```
